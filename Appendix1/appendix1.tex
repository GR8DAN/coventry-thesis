\section*{General}

This template should provide a good starting point for writing up a Coventry University Thesis. It has briefly covered writing \LaTeX{} in Overleaf and MiKTeX. There is plenty of help available for setting up a \LaTeX{} environment on a variety of operating systems and editing in \LaTeX{} from the Internet. The original CUED template provides further information on installing \LaTeX{} environments, see the Appendix in the \textit{thesis.pdf} file at \url{https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template}.
